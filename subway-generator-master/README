App Description
Our app is an auxiliary app for the restaurant chain Subway, and allows users to develop a list of dietary restrictions, ingredient preferences, and cost limitations for subs, which are used to randomly generate a sub meeting these parameters, allowing the user to vary their orders.

Minimal Goals
The goal of the app is to provide an interface for the user to click a button and the app generates a random sandwich order. Users would be able to choose:
The type of meat they would like (if any)
Whether it is a hot or cold sandwich
The type of bread they would like

Stretch Goals
In addition to the minimal goals, we will allow the user to specify:
A minimum and maximum number of calories
Diets like Vegan, Vegetarian, Pescatarian, Lactose Intolerance, Gluten-Free, Paleo, Keto, Mediterranean, Kosher, Halal
Allergies to common substances
Fine tune random orders so that they cater towards a users likings
